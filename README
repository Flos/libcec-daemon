libcec-daemon
A simple daemon to connect libcec to uinput.
by Andrew Brampton

Licence
	Currently under the GPL, but only because libcec (on which we depend)
	is under the GPL. I have full intentions to relicence this project as
	BSD when libcec changes to either LGPL, or I do not need to depend on
	it anymore.

Build
	# Checkout the main source
	git clone

	# Now we need some libraries
        sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev liblog4cplus-dev

	# Also these for building libcec
	sudo apt-get install liblockdev1-dev libudev-dev

	# We use a newer version of libcec, we don't use the one available in
	# packages. So we need to checkout the code using a git submodule
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

	# Then you need to compile libcec
	cd lib/libcec
	autoreconf -vif
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

	# If you have trouble compiling libcec, please refer to their documentaiton.

	# Now continue to build libcec-daemon
	cd ../..
	make

How to use
	./libcec-daemon
