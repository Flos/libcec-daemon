libcec-daemon
A simple daemon to connect libcec to uinput.
by Andrew Brampton

Licence
	Currently under the GPL, but only because libcec (on which we depend) is under the GPL. I have full intentions
	to relicence this project as BSD when libcec changes to either LGPL, or I do not need to depend on it anymore.

Build
	# Checkout the main source
	git clone

	# We use a newer version of libcec, so we need to
	# enable the submodule
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

        # You might need some libraries
        sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev liblog4cplus-dev

	# Now build
	make
